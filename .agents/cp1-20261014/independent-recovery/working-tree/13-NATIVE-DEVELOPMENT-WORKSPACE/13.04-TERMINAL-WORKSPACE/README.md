# 13.04 - Terminal Workspace

## Purpose and boundary

This component belongs to [13-NATIVE-DEVELOPMENT-WORKSPACE](../README.md) and owns the coordinated behavior below. Primary construction role: [R11 Engineering Workspace Engineer](../../AGENT-ROLES/R11-ENGINEERING-WORKSPACE-ENGINEER/README.md). Independent verification: [R20 Independent Adversarial Verifier](../../AGENT-ROLES/R20-INDEPENDENT-ADVERSARIAL-VERIFIER/README.md).

**Required flow:** Create a scoped terminal session; authorize commands; stream bounded output; preserve process ownership; stop or close cleanly; retain safe history.

**Component invariant:** An interactive terminal cannot become an ungoverned route around command execution policy.

**Subsystem invariant:** The interface presents and proposes changes; native services enforce authority and filesystem boundaries. Local projects remain usable without remote hosting.

## Planned implementation files

| Unit and specification | Exact responsibility | Required positive observation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [CETA-13.04.01 / terminal-session-controller](terminal-session-controller.file.README.md) | Create terminal sessions bound to project, authenticated principal, working directory, environment, and process group. Route effectful commands through the governed command boundary. | A terminal command has the same authority and evidence checks as an agent command. |
| [CETA-13.04.02 / command-output-presenter](command-output-presenter.file.README.md) | Stream ordered stdout and stderr with bounded buffering, encoding handling, secret redaction, and exit-state visibility. Preserve full authorized logs through evidence references. | Large output does not freeze the interface and retains an inspectable result reference. |
| [CETA-13.04.03 / terminal-lifecycle-manager](terminal-lifecycle-manager.file.README.md) | Track terminal processes, reconnectable sessions, cancellation, child processes, and close semantics. Verify ownership before stopping and report detached residual work. | Closing a terminal stops or explicitly preserves its owned jobs according to policy. |


Each linked document specifies one logical implementation file, its operations, domain records, contracts, end-to-end procedure, failure handling, agent assignments, and ten acceptance cases. Bind logical paths to the actual local application before editing. Reuse or extend compliant existing units rather than creating parallel owners.

## Domain records

| Field | Type |
| --- | --- |
| terminal_id | text |
| worker_binding | reference |
| working_directory | record |
| output_sequence | integer |
| authority_scope | reference |


Resolve enum domains and shared field semantics from [the common contract rules](../../INTERFACE-CONTRACTS/CONTRACT-COMMON-RULES.md) and the canonical contracts below. Record any application-specific representation decision in the local mapping; preserve exact meaning rather than silently changing the approved behavior.

## Canonical interfaces and integration

[desktop-command](../../INTERFACE-CONTRACTS/USER-INTERACTION/desktop-command.contract.md), [tool-invocation](../../INTERFACE-CONTRACTS/TOOLS-AND-RESOURCES/tool-invocation.contract.md), [human-decision-request](../../INTERFACE-CONTRACTS/USER-INTERACTION/human-decision-request.contract.md), [execution-result](../../INTERFACE-CONTRACTS/EXECUTION/execution-result.contract.md), [persistent-checkpoint](../../INTERFACE-CONTRACTS/STATE-AND-EVIDENCE/persistent-checkpoint.contract.md).

Implement declarations and conformance fixtures before effectful behavior. Use the existing composition mechanism to connect producers and consumers. The internal file list is an ownership map, not a forced call order. Pure checks remain separate from controlled effects, authoritative storage remains with its designated owner, and UI components issue authenticated native commands rather than performing privileged actions themselves.

## Failure and recovery

A malformed record is rejected before privileged work. Missing references, stale versions, invalid authority, and unsupported environment capabilities produce explicit blocked or failed results. An interruption after possible dispatch preserves uncertainty and invokes canonical reconciliation before retry. Keep source and output versions distinct, preserve user drafts and known security decisions, and do not destroy original evidence during repair.

## Construction sequence and acceptance

1. Inspect the mapped local component and record reuse, extension, or creation decisions.
2. Freeze shared contracts and acquire file ownership for the assigned builder.
3. Implement each linked unit and its explicit positive and negative fixtures.
4. Connect the component flow above through real local interfaces and test adverse transitions.
5. Inject interruption, concurrent update, cancellation, and stale-authority conditions where applicable.
6. Hand exact source, output artifacts, and test records to the independent verifier; accept only current evidence.

Component completion requires every linked unit's mandatory acceptance cases plus the integrated flow and invariant. Tests are specified here, not executed by this documentation package.
