# 09.03 - Model Routing

## Purpose and boundary

This component belongs to [09-MODEL-RUNTIME](../README.md) and owns the coordinated behavior below. Primary construction role: [R09 Model Runtime Engineer](../../AGENT-ROLES/R09-MODEL-RUNTIME-ENGINEER/README.md). Independent verification: [R20 Independent Adversarial Verifier](../../AGENT-ROLES/R20-INDEPENDENT-ADVERSARIAL-VERIFIER/README.md).

**Required flow:** Match task requirements; evaluate qualified candidates and resource limits; select a model; request approval for changed data boundaries; record routing and fallback decisions.

**Component invariant:** Fallback preserves authority, privacy, task semantics, and evidence obligations.

**Subsystem invariant:** Model output is untrusted proposed content. Local operation remains complete without a connected endpoint; fallback cannot silently transmit private data.

## Planned implementation files

| Unit and specification | Exact responsibility | Required positive observation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [CETA-09.03.01 / model-capability-matcher](model-capability-matcher.file.README.md) | Match modality, context capacity, structured output needs, language support, and task quality requirements to qualified model profiles. Report unsupported requirements explicitly. | A model is selected only when every required capability is qualified. |
| [CETA-09.03.02 / model-selection-engine](model-selection-engine.file.README.md) | Choose among compatible models using owner policy, resource availability, measured quality, latency, and data locality. Record the exact criteria and selected revision. | A local-only task remains local even when a connected model is faster. |
| [CETA-09.03.03 / model-fallback-controller](model-fallback-controller.file.README.md) | Handle unavailable models through approved alternatives, new resource admission, and explicit consent for any changed data destination. Preserve context provenance and task state across retries. | An approved local fallback continues with compatible constraints and a new recorded inference attempt. |


Each linked document specifies one logical implementation file, its operations, domain records, contracts, end-to-end procedure, failure handling, agent assignments, and ten acceptance cases. Bind logical paths to the actual local application before editing. Reuse or extend compliant existing units rather than creating parallel owners.

## Domain records

| Field | Type |
| --- | --- |
| task_class | enum |
| candidate_models | list |
| data_boundary | enum |
| quality_threshold | record |
| routing_decision | reference |


Resolve enum domains and shared field semantics from [the common contract rules](../../INTERFACE-CONTRACTS/CONTRACT-COMMON-RULES.md) and the canonical contracts below. Record any application-specific representation decision in the local mapping; preserve exact meaning rather than silently changing the approved behavior.

## Canonical interfaces and integration

[model-manifest](../../INTERFACE-CONTRACTS/INTELLIGENCE/model-manifest.contract.md), [inference-request](../../INTERFACE-CONTRACTS/INTELLIGENCE/inference-request.contract.md), [inference-response](../../INTERFACE-CONTRACTS/INTELLIGENCE/inference-response.contract.md), [resource-budget](../../INTERFACE-CONTRACTS/TOOLS-AND-RESOURCES/resource-budget.contract.md), [workload-admission](../../INTERFACE-CONTRACTS/TOOLS-AND-RESOURCES/workload-admission.contract.md), [verification-result](../../INTERFACE-CONTRACTS/STATE-AND-EVIDENCE/verification-result.contract.md).

Implement declarations and conformance fixtures before effectful behavior. Use the existing composition mechanism to connect producers and consumers. The internal file list is an ownership map, not a forced call order. Pure checks remain separate from controlled effects, authoritative storage remains with its designated owner, and UI components issue authenticated native commands rather than performing privileged actions themselves.

## Failure and recovery

A malformed record is rejected before privileged work. Missing references, stale versions, invalid authority, and unsupported environment capabilities produce explicit blocked or failed results. An interruption after possible dispatch preserves uncertainty and invokes canonical reconciliation before retry. Keep source and output versions distinct, preserve user drafts and known security decisions, and do not destroy original evidence during repair.

## Construction sequence and acceptance

1. Inspect the mapped local component and record reuse, extension, or creation decisions.
2. Freeze shared contracts and acquire file ownership for the assigned builder.
3. Implement each linked unit and its explicit positive and negative fixtures.
4. Connect the component flow above through real local interfaces and test adverse transitions.
5. Inject interruption, concurrent update, cancellation, and stale-authority conditions where applicable.
6. Hand exact source, output artifacts, and test records to the independent verifier; accept only current evidence.

Component completion requires every linked unit's mandatory acceptance cases plus the integrated flow and invariant. Tests are specified here, not executed by this documentation package.
