# 20.04 - Resource Pressure

## Purpose and boundary

This component belongs to [20-RESOURCE-MANAGEMENT](../README.md) and owns the coordinated behavior below. Primary construction role: [R17 Resource And Performance Engineer](../../AGENT-ROLES/R17-RESOURCE-AND-PERFORMANCE-ENGINEER/README.md). Independent verification: [R20 Independent Adversarial Verifier](../../AGENT-ROLES/R20-INDEPENDENT-ADVERSARIAL-VERIFIER/README.md).

**Required flow:** Detect sustained pressure; prioritize control and evidence; throttle optional work; stop unsafe admissions; recover gradually after measured stability.

**Component invariant:** Degradation reduces optional capability without weakening governance or evidence requirements.

**Subsystem invariant:** Resource estimates carry uncertainty and are checked against measurements. Stop, evidence, and recovery retain reserved capacity under pressure.

## Planned implementation files

| Unit and specification | Exact responsibility | Required positive observation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [CETA-20.04.01 / resource-pressure-detector](resource-pressure-detector.file.README.md) | Detect memory, storage, compute, queue, and thermal pressure with hysteresis and bounded sampling. Distinguish transient spikes from sustained unsafe conditions. | Sustained pressure triggers a stable response without rapid oscillation. |
| [CETA-20.04.02 / workload-throttling-controller](workload-throttling-controller.file.README.md) | Reduce concurrency, stream rate, batch size, or optional background work within qualified limits. Preserve task correctness and cancel when safe execution cannot be maintained. | Throttling lowers pressure while retaining exact task and authority semantics. |
| [CETA-20.04.03 / graceful-degradation-coordinator](graceful-degradation-coordinator.file.README.md) | Select prequalified reduced-resource modes, preserve local history and control surfaces, and request decisions for changed task quality or scope. Restore capabilities only after readiness checks. | The interface remains usable for stop, evidence, and recovery under heavy load. |


Each linked document specifies one logical implementation file, its operations, domain records, contracts, end-to-end procedure, failure handling, agent assignments, and ten acceptance cases. Bind logical paths to the actual local application before editing. Reuse or extend compliant existing units rather than creating parallel owners.

## Domain records

| Field | Type |
| --- | --- |
| pressure_event | text |
| resource_kind | enum |
| observed_level | integer |
| response_policy | reference |
| affected_tasks | list |


Resolve enum domains and shared field semantics from [the common contract rules](../../INTERFACE-CONTRACTS/CONTRACT-COMMON-RULES.md) and the canonical contracts below. Record any application-specific representation decision in the local mapping; preserve exact meaning rather than silently changing the approved behavior.

## Canonical interfaces and integration

[resource-budget](../../INTERFACE-CONTRACTS/TOOLS-AND-RESOURCES/resource-budget.contract.md), [workload-admission](../../INTERFACE-CONTRACTS/TOOLS-AND-RESOURCES/workload-admission.contract.md), [inference-request](../../INTERFACE-CONTRACTS/INTELLIGENCE/inference-request.contract.md), [inference-response](../../INTERFACE-CONTRACTS/INTELLIGENCE/inference-response.contract.md), [verification-result](../../INTERFACE-CONTRACTS/STATE-AND-EVIDENCE/verification-result.contract.md).

Implement declarations and conformance fixtures before effectful behavior. Use the existing composition mechanism to connect producers and consumers. The internal file list is an ownership map, not a forced call order. Pure checks remain separate from controlled effects, authoritative storage remains with its designated owner, and UI components issue authenticated native commands rather than performing privileged actions themselves.

## Failure and recovery

A malformed record is rejected before privileged work. Missing references, stale versions, invalid authority, and unsupported environment capabilities produce explicit blocked or failed results. An interruption after possible dispatch preserves uncertainty and invokes canonical reconciliation before retry. Keep source and output versions distinct, preserve user drafts and known security decisions, and do not destroy original evidence during repair.

## Construction sequence and acceptance

1. Inspect the mapped local component and record reuse, extension, or creation decisions.
2. Freeze shared contracts and acquire file ownership for the assigned builder.
3. Implement each linked unit and its explicit positive and negative fixtures.
4. Connect the component flow above through real local interfaces and test adverse transitions.
5. Inject interruption, concurrent update, cancellation, and stale-authority conditions where applicable.
6. Hand exact source, output artifacts, and test records to the independent verifier; accept only current evidence.

Component completion requires every linked unit's mandatory acceptance cases plus the integrated flow and invariant. Tests are specified here, not executed by this documentation package.
