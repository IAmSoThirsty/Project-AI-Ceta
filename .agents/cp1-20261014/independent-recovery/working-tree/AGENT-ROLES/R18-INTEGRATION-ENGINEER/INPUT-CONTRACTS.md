# R18 input contract

## Required task input

Provide the task and requirement identities, exact owner-approved scope, mapped local source paths, source baseline digest, canonical contract revisions, dependency readiness, resource and execution permissions, acceptance IDs, and named reviewer. Include existing local tests and data-preservation obligations.

## Domain inputs

Integrate native extensions and all subsystem contracts into the inspected local application.

| [S14 Tool Execution Boundary Engineering](../../AGENT-SKILLS/S14-TOOL-EXECUTION-BOUNDARY-ENGINEERING/SKILL.md) | Tool manifest, exact operation proposal, resource identities, isolation capabilities, and effect observation plan. |
| [S16 Test Generation And Execution](../../AGENT-SKILLS/S16-TEST-GENERATION-AND-EXECUTION/SKILL.md) | Requirements, unit specifications, canonical contracts, inspected test tooling, and controlled fixtures. |
| [S18 Adversarial Security Review](../../AGENT-SKILLS/S18-ADVERSARIAL-SECURITY-REVIEW/SKILL.md) | Explicitly authorized isolated targets, threat boundaries, source changes, and security acceptance cases. |
| [S21 Cross Subsystem Integration](../../AGENT-SKILLS/S21-CROSS-SUBSYSTEM-INTEGRATION/SKILL.md) | Approved contract revisions, mapped local units, dependency graph, source baseline, and migration plan. |


## Admission checks

Confirm that source references exist, match their declared digests, and lie within the permitted local root. Resolve missing or contradictory prerequisites before effectful work. Treat prior summaries as navigation aids, not proof of current implementation. If source or authority changes after inspection, stop the affected edit and revalidate the assignment. Never infer permission from a role name or a task's urgency.
